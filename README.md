# Discord-Bot-Template_slim
A very slim and easier variant of my [Discord-Bot-Template](https://github.com/EliasSchaut/Discord-Bot-Template):
* Just reacting to commands from normal discord messages
* Only `name`, `description` and `usage` as command modifications only used by `help` command (also no handler for that)
* Only `help` command preimplemented
* Very minor config file
* No slash commands or Discord interactions (like buttons or menu) at all
* No different langs
* No database
* No logger
